# Final evaluation Javascript

## Yanira FernÃ¡ndez Requena

This is the page I made for the **module 2: javascript final evaluation** for the **Adalab** front-end course.

We needed to make a website for browsing tv-shows and saving them in your favourite list.

### Basic structure:

1. Button and text field for browsing tv-shows by title.
2. Result list with show title and image.
3. Favourite list.

### Browsing:

- Browse button connects with TVMaze API.
- Result shows a card with show's name and image.
- Shows with no image must have a placeholder image.

### Favourites:

- User can click a show to add it to the favourite list.
- When the show is in the favourite list background and font of the browsed card must change colors.
- Favourites stay on the list when the user searchs for another show.

### Local storage:

- Favourites are stored in local storage so when the user refreshes they show on the list.

### Bonus:

1. Delete favourites:
   - Add a remove button next to each favourite to remove it from the list.
   - Remove favourite when clicking it on the browsed shows list.
   - Button to remove all favourites on one click.
2. Inprove CSS: add CSS styles.
