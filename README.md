# Final evaluation Javascript

## Yanira FernÃ¡ndez Requena

This is the page I made for the **module 2: javascript final evaluation** for the **Adalab** front-end course.

We needed to make a **website for browsing tv-shows** and saving them into your **favourite list**.

We later did a **technical interview** for the evaluation in which we were asked to implement some new features on the spot.

### Basic structure:

1. Button and text field for browsing tv-shows by title.
2. Result list with show title and image.
3. Favourite list.

### Browsing:

- Browse button connects with TVMaze API.
- Result shows a card with show's name and image.
- Shows with no image must have a placeholder.

### Favourites:

- Users can click on a show card to add it to their favourite list.
- When shows are on favourite list, browsed show card background and font must change colors.
- Favourites stay on the list when users browse another show.

### Local storage:

- Favourites are stored in local storage. When the user refreshes the page they stay on the list.

### Bonus:

1. Delete favourites:
   - Add remove button next to each favourite to remove it from the list.
   - Remove favourite when clicking it on their browsed shows card.
   - Button to remove all favourites on one click.
2. Add CSS styles.

## Technical interview:
During the technical interview for the evaluation I was asked to:
1. Create a new branch, "evaluation".
2. Add premiere date to browsed show cards.
3. Add the number of browsed shows on top of the list.
   - This number needs to be clickable.
   - I was given an array with numbers.
   - When clicked, there is a console log saying if the numbers of browsed shows is higher or lower than the numbers in the array.
4. Merge this branch with master branch.
